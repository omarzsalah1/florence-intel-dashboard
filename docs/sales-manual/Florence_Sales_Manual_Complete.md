### Chapter 2: The Traditional CCA Process (Before Florence)

The traditional Comprehensive Care Assessment (CCA) process is a manual, time-consuming, and often inefficient workflow that places a heavy burden on care navigators and providers. Understanding these pain points is critical to articulating the value of Florence.

**The Manual CCA Workflow:**

1. **Manual Data Review:** The process begins when a care navigator manually reviews data from the Care Opportunities and Outcomes Platform (COOP) to identify patients who are due for a CCA (e.g., recently discharged, due for an AWV).
2. **Manual Chart Review:** The navigator then manually reviews the patient's chart in the EHR to identify all potential care gaps, including suspect diagnoses, quality measures, and frailty indicators.
3. **Manual Patient Outreach:** The navigator manually calls the patient to schedule a Transitional Care Management (TCM) call and a follow-up appointment.
4. **Manual Documentation Preparation:** Before the appointment, the navigator manually prepares all necessary documentation, including a summary of care gaps and supporting evidence.
5. **Provider Encounter:** During the visit, the provider must manually review the patient's chart and the navigator's notes to address care gaps, often without real-time decision support.
6. **Manual Follow-up:** After the visit, the navigator manually coordinates any necessary follow-up, such as specialist referrals or patient education.

**Key Pain Points of the Manual Process:**

| Pain Point | Description |
|---|---|
| **Time-Consuming** | The manual process can take **4-6 hours of navigator time per patient**, limiting the number of patients a single navigator can manage. |
| **Inconsistent Gap Identification** | Manual chart review is prone to human error, leading to missed care gaps and lost revenue opportunities. |
| **Provider Documentation Burden** | Providers spend a significant amount of time on documentation, taking away from patient care. |
| **Missed Follow-up Opportunities** | Manual follow-up is often inconsistent, leading to poor care coordination and patient outcomes. |
| **Limited Scalability** | The manual process is not scalable, making it difficult for practices to manage a growing patient population. |

### Chapter 3: The CCA Lifecycle with Florence

Florence transforms the CCA process by automating and enhancing each phase of the lifecycle, from trigger to ongoing management. This integrated approach ensures a seamless, efficient, and effective workflow.

**The 5 Phases of the CCA Lifecycle with Florence:**

1. **Trigger:** Florence automatically detects CCA triggers from COOP in real-time, including hospital discharge notifications, Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) due dates, new quality measure gaps, and suspect diagnosis gaps.

2. **Pre-Encounter:** Once a trigger is detected, Florence initiates the pre-encounter workflow — compiling all necessary CCA components from COOP and the EHR, automatically scheduling and conducting the TCM outreach call using the **Engage** workflow, confirming the follow-up appointment with the patient, and staging all identified care gaps for provider review.

3. **Encounter:** During the patient visit, Florence acts as a real-time copilot for the provider — displaying all staged gaps with supporting evidence in a convenient sidebar within athenaOne, allowing the provider to accept, reject, or defer each gap with a single click, and auto-generating MEAT-criteria documentation in real-time as gaps are accepted.

4. **Post-Encounter:** After the visit, Florence automates the post-encounter workflow — coordinating specialist referrals and follow-up appointments, sending automated patient education materials, and using the **Convene** workflow to facilitate care team meetings.

5. **Ongoing Chronic Condition Management:** Florence provides ongoing support for patients with chronic conditions — using the **Check-In** workflow to conduct routine monitoring via SMS, tracking medication adherence and care plan progress, and escalating to a human navigator when necessary.

## Part 2: The Pre-Encounter Workflow & Demo Scripts

### Chapter 4: The Navigator's View — Automating Pre-Encounter Tasks

This chapter details the pre-encounter workflow from the care navigator's perspective. The goal is to demonstrate how Florence automates the most time-consuming manual tasks, allowing navigators to operate at the top of their license.

**Demo Scenario:**
- **Patient:** Jane Doe, 68 y/o female, recently discharged from St. Joseph's Hospital after an acute MI.
- **Trigger:** Florence receives a real-time discharge notification from COOP.
- **Objective:** Demonstrate how Florence automates the TCM call, schedules the follow-up appointment, and stages all relevant care gaps for provider review.

---

#### Step 1: Open the Florence Dashboard

When you first open the Florence AI Navigator, you see the side-by-side view: the athenaOne EHR on the left and the Florence Copilot sidebar on the right. The patient's chart is already loaded with all relevant clinical data.

![Florence Dashboard Overview — Navigator View](screenshots/01_full_dashboard_overview.png)
*Figure 1: The Florence AI Navigator integrated into athenaOne. The left panel shows the patient's EHR chart, while the right panel displays the Florence Copilot with patient summary, workflow buttons, and care gaps.*

---

#### Step 2: Review the Patient Summary

The Florence Copilot sidebar immediately shows the patient's key information at a glance. Jane Doe is flagged as **High Risk** and enrolled in **CCM** (Chronic Care Management). The three workflow buttons — **Engage**, **Convene**, and **Check-In** — are prominently displayed, along with tabs for Overview, Transcript, and Documentation.

![Florence Copilot Sidebar](screenshots/02_copilot_sidebar_overview.png)
*Figure 2: The Florence Copilot sidebar showing patient summary (Jane Doe, 68 y/o F, High Risk, CCM), workflow action buttons, and the Overview tab with Florence Summary.*

---

#### Step 3: Review Care & Diagnosis Gaps

Scrolling down in the Copilot sidebar, you can see all **9 Care & Diagnosis Gaps** that Florence has automatically identified from COOP. The gaps are organized by category using filter buttons: **All (9)**, **Recapture (0)**, **Suspect (4)**, **Quality (3)**, and **Frailty (2)**.

![Care & Diagnosis Gaps List](screenshots/03_care_diagnosis_gaps.png)
*Figure 3: The Care & Diagnosis Gaps section showing all 9 identified gaps with category filters. Each gap shows its type (Suspect/Quality/Frailty), source (COOP), and priority level.*

**Demo Script:**

> **Sales Rep:** "What you're seeing here is the Florence AI Navigator, which is integrated directly into athenaOne. The moment Jane Doe was discharged from the hospital, Florence received a notification from COOP and automatically initiated the pre-encounter workflow. Let's walk through what Florence has already done.
>
> First, Florence automatically compiled all of Jane's relevant information, including her discharge summary, medications, and all of her open care gaps from COOP. You can see here that Florence has identified 9 gaps in total: 4 suspect gaps, 3 quality measures, and 2 frailty gaps."

### Chapter 7: Provider Best Practices

To maximize the value of Florence, providers should follow these best practices during the patient encounter:

**Trust the Staged Gaps:** The care gaps staged by Florence are based on real-time data from COOP, which is the source of truth for gap validation. Providers can trust that these gaps are accurate and up-to-date.

**Leverage the Sidebar:** The Florence sidebar is designed to be an at-a-glance resource. Providers should use it to quickly review all open gaps and supporting evidence without leaving the patient's chart.

**Embrace One-Click Attestation:** The one-click MEAT criteria attestation is a powerful time-saving feature. Providers should use it to quickly document their clinical decisions rather than manually typing notes.

**Review Auto-Generated Documentation:** While Florence's documentation is highly accurate, providers should always give it a quick review before signing the note. This ensures clinical accuracy and maintains the provider's professional responsibility.
